# Requirements analysis

## About
 The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the basic functionality of a blockchain.
## Basic functionality
 - create blocks manually
 - add data into the block
 - add a hash for the blocks
## Further development ideas
 After completing the basic functionality some of the following will be added:
 - combining the individual blocks into a chain (done week 6)
 - calculating a hash based on the block's data
 - confirming the correctness of the blockchain (done week 6)
 - demonstrating mining (done week 6)
 - connect the chain with google sheets
 - correct google sheets if manipulated from outside of the app (done week 6)
