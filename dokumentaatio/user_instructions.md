# User Instructions

## Running the application

First download the [jar file](https://github.com/joonakauranen/ot-harjoitustyo/releases/tag/week6).
Then run the command java -jar blockchainexperiment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

A command-line based user interface will start running.

The first thing the UI does is it asks the user if Google Sheets should be used. Disclaimer: The app hasn't been verified by Google and is a school project so use at your own risk. If you decide to proceed to use Google Sheets you will need to log in to a Google account.
The app hasn't been verified by Google so you will need to open the _advanced_ section and click _Go to Quickstart (unsafe)_.

After granting the necessary rights a Google Sheets spreadsheet will open in your browser.

Now you should see the main view in your command-line. If you chose not to use Google Sheets option 4 will be excluded from the command-line instructions.
